Currently my interests are in character modeling. In my free time I DM a virtual Star Wars 5th Edition DND game, of which I create all the art and assets myself and also enjoy spending my time at the gym or playing piano.  I also run a small 2d art commission business on the side. For this project I will be working on the character model as well as animations.`

                    Grim Vision Studios was founded by Jonathan Wright, and Bryce Montgomery around August 17th, of 2021. With a message sent inside of a College Degree Discord, Jonathan sent out a message indicating the start of a game, and a possible studio. Bryce found this as an opportunity to make amazing games, while giving students and recent graduates the chance to break into the industry! Bryce began reaching out to Full Sail students to find out who was interested in making a game, and between that and people bringing on others they knew that they thought would be a good fit to help with development, we got to where we are today.
